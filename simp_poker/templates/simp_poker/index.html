        <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
        <p>
            This is the main page for the game <em>{{ game.name }}</em>. This is a simplified
            variant of the Poker game.
             For this variant of Poker there are just two players and three cards: King of Hearts, Queen of Hearts, and Jack of Hearts. The rules are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player puts one dollar into the pot.</li>
            <li>Each player draws one of the cards.</li>
            <li>Player 1 chooses whether she wants to <em>bet</em> or <em>fold</em>. Betting means putting one extra dollar into the pot. Folding means giving up. If she folds, player 2 gets all the money in the pot and the game ends.</li>
            <li>If the game did not end yet, player 2 chooses whether she wants to <em>call</em> the other player's bet or <em>fold</em>. Calling the bet means also putting one extra dollar into the pot. Folding again means giving up. If she folds, player 1 gets all the money in the pot and the game ends.</li>
            <li>If the game did not end yet, we reach the <em>showdown</em>: both players show their cards and the one with the higher card gets all the money in the pot. Here King beats Queen beats Jack.</li>
        </ul>
