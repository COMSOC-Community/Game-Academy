To consider for later:

* Static display of IPD automatas as in https://gist.github.com/mbostock/1667139 https://gist.github.com/mbostock/6526445e2b44303eebf21da3b6627320
* Move IPD display to d3 v7
* Anonymise teams in IPD results
* Left panel floating, with user info (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11399537/how-do-you-make-a-div-follow-as-you-scroll)

Other (minor) issues regarding presentation (CENTIPEDE):
- Better to rows and columns (so strategy 1 goes into the rows).
- No comma before ‘and’ for a list of two winners.
