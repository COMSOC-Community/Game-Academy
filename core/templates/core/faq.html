                    The portal of a session is the page from which the users can enter the session
                    (via logging in for instance). The home is the page in which players see all the

                    Users can either have a global account, or an account that is specific to a session.
                    We call the latter restricted users. Users are restricted when a non-authenticated
                    person creates a player profile from the portal of a session.

                <p>
                    Restricted users can only access the content of the session to which they registered.
                    Whenever they try to access a page outside of the session, a prompt will require
                    them to log out first.

                    Guest players are users who joined the session without registering. These players

                    An admin of a session can also change the password of the players of the session.
                    This is only possible for players who are restricted to the session. Use this
                    functionality if a player has lost their password, for instance. The links to
                    change the password of the players are located in the tables available at

                <ul>
                    <li><code>SESSION_URL/admin/</code> for the parameters of the session,</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><code>SESSION_URL/admin/game/GAME_URL_TAG</code> for the settings of the game,</li>

                    This probably means that you did not update the setting of the game so that the results are visible.

        <h2>Setting up a Session for a Course</h2>

        <p>
            Are you using the game academy for a course? Here are few ideas that you can use to set up
            your session.
        </p>

        <div class="faq-wrap">
            <h3>Accounts for the Students</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                    <strong>Via registration.</strong> Once you have created the session, you can open
                    the registration to allow the students to register for your session. Registration
                    can be closed again after some time to avoid students creating more than one account
                    (which would allow them to have additional influence in the games).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Via upload.</strong> You can also upload a CSV file with the account details
                    to pre-create player profiles for your students. This is done under via form in
                    the page: <code>SESSION_URL/admin/players</code>. You do not need
                    to ever open the registration to your session. This ensures that all students have
                    an account (and no more than one).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opening and closing the registration is done by updating the session parameters
                    on the page <code>SESSION_URL/admin</code>.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    If you need more workforce, simply for running the management commands on time
                    for instance, you can add admins to the session. Do so on the page:
                    <code>SESSION_URL/admin/players</code>.

        <h2>Setting up a Session for a One-Shot Event</h2>

        <p>
            Do you want to use the game-academy for an event in which the participants can easily play
            one of the games? Here are some ideas on how to set up the session.
        </p>

        <div class="faq-wrap">
            <h3>Guest Players Only</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                    To reduce the overhead, consider disabling the display of the registration and
                    logging in forms in the session portal. To do so, update the session parameters
                    on the page <code>SESSION_URL/admin</code>.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-wrap">
            <h3>Game After Login</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                    If you are only using a single game in your session, save one click by setting
                    up a direct redirect to a game after login. This skips the session home.
                    To do so, update the parameters of the session
                    on the page <code>SESSION_URL/admin</code>.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-wrap">
            <h3>Display the Results of the Games Directly</h3>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>
                    If you want the players to have direct feedback after submitting an answer, you
                    can select the result page to be the page after submit of a game. To do so,
                    update the settings of the game
                    on the page <code>SESSION_URL/admin/game/GAME_URL_TAG</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Consider running the management commands automatically as well. That is
                    necessary for the games that need them to display the result page properly.
                    This is also done by updating the settings of the game on the page
                    <code>SESSION_URL/admin/game/GAME_URL_TAG</code>. This can incur delay in the
                    response, especially as the number of players increases.

            The Prisoner's Dilemma is the classical two-player game in which each player must choose between two actions

            In its iterated version, the two players repeatedly play the game for a fixed number of rounds, their final
            gains/losses being the average of their gains/losses for each individual instance of the game.

        <p>
            In the game academy, a round-robin tournament is organise between all the players: every player competes
            against every other player. The total score of a player is their average score.
